This is a utility that solves a very specific problem I have. I like to take my old PCs and stuff them in a server chassis for the ability to boot them up when needed or like for example if there is an old game I want to play on an old OS. 

The problem is that Wake On LAN isn't always available for these machines or its inconsistent. So the easiest solution is just to walk over and turn on the PC but sometimes that isn't possible. So having a little web utility that can "physically" press the power button is the best option, if a bit janky.

## Final Notes

This project was really just an excuse to do some stuff in C which is not something I get to do super often anymore.
